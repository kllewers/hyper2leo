# hyper2leo

This software package allows for people to put in hyperspectral wavelength information and conversions for Sentinel2A and all Landsat missions up to 2023 with NEON 
data already input. This software package also has the ability to ingest instrumentation specification from a csv to see where specific hyperspectral instruments can 
fall within these larger satellite multispectral  bands.

### Updates

If you would like to see additional conversions put in, please reach out to kristen.lewers@colorado.edu
