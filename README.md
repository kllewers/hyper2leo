# hyper2leo

This software package allows for people to put in hyperspectral wavelength information and conversions for Sentinel2A and all Landsat missions up to 2023. 

UPCOMING FEATURES: NEON data for hyperspectral bands and bandwidth. Also, the ability to ingest instrumentation specification from a csv to see where specific hyperspectral instruments can 
fall within these larger satellite multispectral  bands.

### Updates

If you would like to see additional conversions put in, please reach out to kristen.lewers@colorado.edu
